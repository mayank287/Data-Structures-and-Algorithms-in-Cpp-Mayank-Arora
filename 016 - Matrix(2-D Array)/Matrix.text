Matrix Info
1> Elements are Stored in Row - Major Order
Means They Follow Store Elements in Row Form in Memory
Suppose if Every Element Can Take 4 Bytes
10(2000) 20(2004) 30(2008) 40(2012)
Element(Memory Location) 

2> Internally Curly Brackets are Optional 
int arr[3][2] = {10,20,30,40,50,60};
But It is Good To Use It

3> Only The First Dimension Can be Omitted When We Initialize
int [][2] = {{1,2},{3,4}};

1> in Binary Indexed Trees the Number can be expressed as Power of 2
    for Example 
    14 = 2^3 + 2 ^ 2 + 2 ^1
    10 = 2 ^ 3 + 2 ^ 1 (  ^ = Power)



2> in Binary Indexed Tree Indexs and expressed as Power 2 and Their children
3> and They Fill in Bit Array and Also Zero Index is Dummy Node and Not Filled With any 
Value

//*********************** Upper Bound **********************************//
1. Upper Bound is Used To Find The Next Greater value of given value
2. It is Also Used To Find The Value of Last Occurrence

 Internal Working and Time Complexity of This 
3. This Used binary Seach Internally and advance() Function in Internally
4. So The Time Complexity is o(logn)

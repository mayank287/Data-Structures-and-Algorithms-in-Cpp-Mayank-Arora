Binary Heap
1> Used in Heap Sort
2> Used to Implement Priority Queue
3> Two Types
 a> Min Heap
 b> Max Heap


 Binary Heap is Complete Binary Tree( Stored as an Array) 

 left(i) = 2i + 1
 right(i) = 2i + 2
 parent(i) = floor(i - 1 / 2)



 Min Heap
 1> Complete Binary Tree
 2> Every Node has Value Smaller then its Descendants

        /   \
       20   15
      /  \   /
     30  40  18

  as an Array = {10,20,15,30,40,18}
